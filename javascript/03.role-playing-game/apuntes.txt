#JavaScript interacts with the HTML using the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM is a tree of objects that represents the HTML.
 You can access the HTML using the document object, which represents your entire HTML document.

 One method for finding specific elements in your HTML is using the querySelector() method. The querySelector() method takes a CSS 
 selector as an argument and returns the first element that matches that selector. For example, to find the <h1> element in your HTML, you would write:

Example Code
let h1 = document.querySelector("h1");

#We have run into a slight problem. You are trying to query your page for a button element, but your script tag is in the head of your HTML. This means
 your code runs before the browser has finished reading the HTML, and your document.querySelector() will not see the button - because the browser hasn't processed it yet.

To fix this, move your script element out of the head element, and place it at the end of your body element (just before the closing </body> tag).
