/*
The transform-origin property is used to set the point around which a CSS transformation is applied. For example, when 
performing a rotate (which you will do later in this project), the transform-origin determines around which point the 
element is rotated.

The animation-name property is used to link a @keyframes rule to a CSS selector. The value of this property should match the 
name of the @keyframes rule. Give your .wheel selector an animation-name property set to wheel.

The animation-duration property is used to set how long the animation should sequence to complete. The time should be specified 
in either seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).
