The loading attribute on an img element can be set to lazy to tell the browser not to fetch the image resource until 
it is needed (as in, when the user scrolls the image into view). As an additional benefit, lazy loaded elements will 
not load until the non-lazy elements are loaded - this means users with slow internet connections can view the content 
of your page without having to wait for the images to load.

The Referer HTTP header contains information about the address or URL of a page that a user might be visiting from. This 
information can be used in analytics to track how many users from your page visit freecodecamp.org, for example. Setting 
the rel attribute to noreferrer omits this information from the HTTP request. Give your a element a rel attribute set to 
noreferrer.

Use the minmax function to make your columns responsive on any device. The minmax function takes two arguments, the 
first being the minimum value and the second being the maximum. These values could be a length, percentage, fr, or even 
a keyword like max-content.

The object-fit property tells the browser how to position the element within its container. In this case, cover will set 
the image to fill the container, cropping as needed to avoid changing the aspect ratio.
